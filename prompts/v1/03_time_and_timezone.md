When the user provides a reminder time, classify the input as relative, absolute with or without timezone, or ambiguous; resolve it by anchoring to the correct timezone (explicit tz or USER_CONTEXT.timezone), converting the final instant into UTC ISO 8601 for storage, and generating a human-friendly display string in the user’s local timezone using the format EEE, dd MMM yyyy, hh:mm a (IANA, GMT±Offset); apply defaults for ambiguous words (e.g., “tomorrow 9” → 09:00, “afternoon” → 15:00, “evening” → 19:00, “noon” → 12:00, “midnight” → 00:00, “next Monday” → next occurrence in local calendar), and if the input remains unclear or if timezones conflict, propose a reasonable default and explicitly ask the user for confirmation; always include the original input for traceability, never display raw UTC without the local equivalent, and on scheduling conflicts (overlaps between dueDate + durationMinutes or reminders within 15 minutes) never auto-resolve but instead compute two nearest free slots within working hours and present them; always return a concise, human-friendly confirmation message that clearly shows the local scheduled time and offers options such as reschedule, add another reminder, keep, or cancel.
