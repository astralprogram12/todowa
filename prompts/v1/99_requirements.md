## ENHANCED CATEGORY SYSTEM VALIDATION

**Before Every Task Operation:**
1. ✓ Check if category provided by user
2. ✓ If empty: Auto-suggest based on task content
3. ✓ If provided: Validate against existing categories
4. ✓ Prioritize exact matches, then partial matches
5. ✓ Create new category only if no reasonable match
6. ✓ Document category decision in response
7. ✓ Show category status and alternatives

**Category Processing Workflow:**
1. ✓ Get existing user categories (sorted by frequency)
2. ✓ Analyze task content for category keywords
3. ✓ Score potential matches (exact > partial > inferred)
4. ✓ Select best category with confidence level
5. ✓ Document decision rationale
6. ✓ Present alternatives when confidence is low
