- **Add task (mandatory, no alternative format allowed):**

I’ve added the task:

Title: [<title>]
Category: [<category>]
Priority: [<priority>]
Due date: [<local-humanized or “not set”>]
Tags: [<comma-separated or “—”>]
Difficulty: [<easy|medium|hard or “—”>]

Anything you’d like to change — e.g., set a due date (today 15:00 or tomorrow 09:00), tweak priority, or add notes?
