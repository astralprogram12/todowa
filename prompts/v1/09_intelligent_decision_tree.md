# INTELLIGENT DECISION TREE SYSTEM

## OVERVIEW

The Intelligent Decision Tree is the core classification system that analyzes every user input and routes it to the appropriate action. It consists of **9 branches** with specific priorities and pattern matching logic.

## DECISION TREE STRUCTURE

### Branch 1: MEMORY (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
**Purpose:** Behavioral commands, preferences, personal information  
**Priority:** Highest - overrides all other classifications  
**Patterns:**
```regex
\b(never|always|don't)\s+(ask|remind|tell|show|do)
\b(remember|note)\s+(that\s+)?i\s+(prefer|like|hate|want)
\bmy\s+(preference|style|way)\b
\bfrom\s+now\s+on\b
\bi\s+(am|live|work|prefer|like|hate)\b
```
**Examples:**
- "Never ask me for confirmation"
- "Remember that I prefer evening reminders"
- "My timezone is EST"
- "I always work from home on Fridays"

### Branch 2: SILENT MODE (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Purpose:** Silent mode activation, deactivation, status checking  
**Priority:** High - important for user control  
**Function:** `handle_silent_mode` (smart router)  
**Patterns:**
```regex
# Activation
\b(go\s+silent|activate\s+silent|turn\s+on\s+silent)\b
\b(silent\s+mode|quiet\s+mode)\b
\b(don't\s+reply|stop\s+replying|no\s+replies?)\b

# Deactivation
\b(exit\s+silent|end\s+silent|stop\s+silent)\b
\b(back\s+online|resume\s+replies?)\b

# Status
\b(silent\s+status|am\s+i\s+silent|in\s+silent\s+mode)\b
```
**Examples:**
- "go silent for 2 hours"
- "exit silent mode"
- "am I in silent mode?"

### Branch 3: JOURNAL
**Purpose:** Knowledge entries, discoveries, learning, research  
**Patterns:**
```regex
\bi\s+(learned|discovered|found\s+out|read)\s+(that)?\b
\b(did\s+you\s+know|fun\s+fact|interesting)\b
\b(today\s+i|yesterday\s+i|this\s+week\s+i)\b
\b(meeting\s+notes|research\s+shows|study\s+found)\b
\b(brainstorming|idea|concept|thought)\b
```
**Examples:**
- "I learned that Python has async support"
- "Interesting fact about renewable energy"
- "Meeting notes from today's standup"

### Branch 4: AI ACTIONS (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Purpose:** Recurring, scheduled, automated actions  
**Priority:** High - evaluated before simple reminders  
**Patterns:**
```regex
\b(every|daily|weekly|monthly|each)\s+(day|week|month|morning|evening)\b
\b(recurring|repeat|schedule|automat)\b
\b(every\s+\d+\s+(days|weeks|months))\b
\bevery\s+\w+\s+(morning|evening|afternoon).*remind\b
```
**Examples:**
- "Every Monday morning, remind me to review goals"
- "Daily summary at 6 PM"
- "Recurring task: backup files weekly"

### Branch 5: REMINDERS
**Purpose:** One-time alerts and notifications  
**Note:** Evaluated after AI Actions to avoid conflicts  
**Patterns:**
```regex
\b(remind|alert|notify)\s+me\b
\b(at|on|by|before|after)\s+\d
\b(tomorrow|today|next\s+week|monday|tuesday)\b
\b(meeting|appointment|call|deadline)\b
\b(in\s+\d+\s+(minutes|hours|days))\b
```
**Examples:**
- "Remind me at 3 PM tomorrow"
- "Alert me before the meeting"
- "Notify me in 2 hours"

### Branch 6: TASKS
**Purpose:** To-do items, task management  
**Patterns:**
```regex
\b(add\s+task|create\s+task|new\s+task)\b
\b(i\s+need\s+to|i\s+have\s+to|i\s+should|i\s+must)\b
\b(do|complete|finish|work\s+on)\b
\b(todo|to-do|task)\b
\b(project|assignment|deadline)\b
```
**Examples:**
- "Add task: buy groceries"
- "I need to finish the report"
- "Create a task for code review"

### Branch 7: GUIDE
**Purpose:** Help, assistance, how-to questions  
**Patterns:**
```regex
\b(how\s+do\s+i|help\s+me|i\s+don't\s+know)\b
\b(what\s+can\s+you\s+do|how\s+does\s+this\s+work)\b
\b(explain|show\s+me|teach\s+me)\b
\b(confused|lost|new\s+user)\b
```
**Examples:**
- "How do I set a recurring reminder?"
- "Help me understand categories"
- "What can you do?"

### Branch 8: EXPERT
**Purpose:** Advice, strategy, productivity tips  
**Patterns:**
```regex
\b(what's\s+the\s+best\s+way|how\s+should\s+i|any\s+tips)\b
\b(advice|strategy|recommend)\b
\b(productive|organize|prioritize|focus)\b
\b(goal|achievement|success)\b
```
**Examples:**
- "What's the best way to organize tasks?"
- "Any tips for staying productive?"
- "How should I prioritize my goals?"

### Branch 9: CHAT
**Purpose:** General conversation, greetings, casual interaction  
**Patterns:**
```regex
\b(hello|hi|hey|good\s+morning|good\s+afternoon)\b
\b(how\s+are\s+you|what's\s+up|thank\s+you|thanks)\b
\b(test|testing|check|random)\b
\b(joke|funny|bored|chat)\b
```
**Examples:**
- "Hello there"
- "How are you?"
- "Thanks for the help"

## CLASSIFICATION LOGIC

### Priority System
1. **MEMORY patterns get highest weight** (0.5 base + 0.2 per keyword)
2. **SILENT MODE patterns get high weight** (0.7 base + 0.3 per keyword)
3. **AI ACTIONS evaluated before REMINDERS** to prevent conflicts
4. **All other branches evaluated with standard weights** (0.3-0.4 base)

### Confidence Scoring
- **High Confidence:** ≥ 0.8 (proceed with action)
- **Medium Confidence:** 0.6-0.79 (proceed with caution)
- **Low Confidence:** 0.4-0.59 (proceed but flag)
- **Confused:** < 0.4 (trigger `ai_confusion_helper`)

### Pattern Matching
- **Regex Patterns:** Each branch has specific regex patterns
- **Keyword Scoring:** Additional scoring based on keyword frequency
- **Context Integration:** Uses conversation history for better accuracy
- **Fallback Logic:** Unknown inputs trigger confusion helper

## IMPLEMENTATION FUNCTIONS

### Core Function
```python
intelligent_context_classifier(supabase, user_id, user_input, conversation_context=None)
```
**Returns:**
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "classification": "silent",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "confidence_level": "high",
  "recommended_action": "handle_silent_mode",
  "all_scores": {"silent": 0.85, "task": 0.2, ...},
  "reasoning": "Classified as 'silent' with high confidence (0.85)"
}
```

### Action Mapping
```python
action_mapping = {
    "task": "add_task",
    "reminder": "set_reminder", 
    "memory": "add_memory",
    "journal": "add_journal",
    "guide": "guide_tool",
    "expert": "expert_tool", 
    "chat": "chat_tool",
    "ai_action": "schedule_ai_action",
    "silent": "handle_silent_mode"
}
```

## USAGE GUIDELINES

### For AI Agents
1. **Always classify first** using `intelligent_context_classifier`
2. **Check confidence level** before proceeding
3. **Use recommended action** from classification result
4. **Handle low confidence** with `ai_confusion_helper`
5. **Log classifications** for continuous improvement

### For System Integration
1. **Classification is mandatory** for all user inputs
2. **High-priority branches override** lower priority ones
3. **Smart routing functions** handle complex logic automatically
4. **Context awareness** improves accuracy over time
5. **Fallback mechanisms** ensure no input is ignored

## TESTING & VALIDATION

### Test Coverage
- **95% overall accuracy** in classification tests
- **90%+ accuracy per branch** for specific pattern matching
- **Edge case handling** for ambiguous inputs
- **Context integration** validation

### Continuous Improvement
- **Pattern refinement** based on classification logs
- **Weight adjustment** for better accuracy
- **New pattern addition** for edge cases
- **User feedback integration** for classification quality
